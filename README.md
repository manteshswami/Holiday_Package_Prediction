*Holiday Package Prediction using Machine Learning* 

- Developed a machine learning model to predict customer interest in various holiday packages for a fictional company, Trips & Travel.Com. The aim was to optimize marketing efforts by analyzing historical customer data.
- Key steps included:
  - Cleaned and explored a dataset with 4888 records and 20 features
  - Applied Random Forest Classifier with hyperparameter tuning
  - Achieved *93.37%* accuracy and *0.83* ROC AUC score on test data
  - Plotted ROC-AUC curve to evaluate classifier performance
  - Improved decision-making efficiency for launching a new Wellness Tourism Package
This project demonstrates proficiency in Python, pandas, scikit-learn, data visualization, and model evaluation techniques.
